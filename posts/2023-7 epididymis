Epididymis blog
Macroview
The epididymis is part of the male reproductive structure that provides pathway for sperm to travel from the testis to the vans deferens. The epididymis structure is made up of a single,tightly coiled tube that can stretch 20ft-23ft in human anatomical structures.  
The epididymis can be broken down into the caput, corpus, and cauda regions, proximal to distal positions from where it emerges from the testes.  
Efferent ducts allow the transfer of spermatozoa from the testis into the caput epididymis in which they are not fully developed and lack tails and mobility.
